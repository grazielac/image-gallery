## Reflection
ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
- I managed to put thumbnail at the top, and 
- responsive design that works well on both small and larger screens
- Implement three media queries
- Use of event handlers to switch images 
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
- when clicking button on the full-size image, i couldn't change the thumbnail respetive thumbnail
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
- I struggle to understand the use of funcction when declaring it for event listeners, or how to write it. Idk if there's an actual template for this but just putting them all together was a bit tricky. 
- Global and local scope. Not sure where to put functions, event listeners

## Other reflections
- I asked AI to help me break down tasks step by step without giving me the actual codes so it's easier to translate back when i write the code
- errors/bugs: case-sensitive wrong spelling, incorrect input of code outside the scope 
- I might have to deep study this one as I really struggle to fully and clearly put the pieces together.
